      <p class="md:text-xl text-lg  font-normal title-font text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">Owing to their superpower to infuse this world with their selfless love, animals have always been our haven in distressed times. But isn't love a two way street? Growing up we always wanted to have a pet, any kind would do only if our parents would allow it. We tried rescuing stray birds, cats and all sorts of critters but always had to give them up. Until one fine day our parents gave in and let us adopt our first dog. She was a ball of fur that came into our lives on a whim and changed it completely for the better. Living with her taught us compassion, kindness and what it was to be selfless. Tempting as it was, to keep this happiness to ourselves, we knew the world could do with  little more love.  This encouraged us to help all the animals that needed somebody there for them.</p>
        
      <p class="md:text-xl text-lg  font-normal title-font text-gray-700  text-justify"> From then we started caring for, feeding and taking care of animals in our vicinity. Realization soon set in that just feeding them is not enough and providing a home for them would be the best thing that they could ask for, where the networking for adoption started. Starting small from publicizing potential adoptions via personal contacts, we grew and finally have taken a big step into what has been a dream for years together. </p>

          <p class="md:text-xl text-lg  font-normal title-font text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify ">Passing through the streets of India, all we see is abandoned animals seeking shelter alongside footpaths and finding places to shelter themselves from rain, storm or sun. A majority of the times these animals are driven away from street corners they call homes. As AdoptionHQ our mission is to give these lost souls a forever home. When we faltered and tripped, often jeopardising our rescue operations , identifying and tying the loose threads became our mission. This grind became the foundation of our organization, cemented by our zest, and each success story only made us stronger.  </p>

          <p class="md:text-xl text-lg font-normal title-font text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify ">We are a non-profit organization that works towards bridging the gap between potential adopters and animals from shelters, fosters and the streets. . We provide a platform for anyone, who desires to help in their best capabilities. Alongside this we aim to create awareness about the benefits of adoption. In the long run, we dream of empty shelters and providing a roof over the heads of as many animals as we can. For each of you who cares youâ€™ll only make our community stronger. Together we can. Together we will! </p>

        took, counted. The idea of AdoptionHQ came into being after studying the various obstacles I
        faced while doing my part for the benefit of the animals. Giving them a safe haven they can call
        home, is something I am vehemently passionate about and I hope to see these animals reach

Pets bring so much joy in ones life, more than it may appear. Along with love, joy, companionship and lots of dopamine, animals make me feel secure because of the unconditional love they provide.  </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2 text-justify">Being able to take care of pets is a privilege for me, it gives me a sense of purpose and validation that I need. Animals have given me so much it only made sense to try and give back something which I can never repay. I learned about AdoptionHQ and was hooked to the idea of it. I wanted to be a part of this so bad, there was nothing like this anywhere in my knowledge. I truly hope you will find the joy in animals as I did and cute little munchkins will find a loving home. </p>
